If you had this job, you might describe it as:

"My name is ______ and I am in charge of building and supporting the Meducation community.

Meducation is made up of hundreds of smaller communities, such as universities, and groups of doctors in the same speciality and location.

My job is to support these smaller communities, and has three main areas:
1) I find a representative in each of these communities and work with them to understand how they want Meducation to work for them. I care about people and work hard to make sure these representatives feel supported. 
2) I work with our development team to make sure that Meducation has the features that our community want, and am instrimental in guiding new ideas and sections on the website.
3) I work with the marketing team, and help them shape their advertising campaigns correctly for our community. I understand what each community gets from Meducation, so I am a crucial part of decision around marketting correctly.

My role is varied, interesting, and involves me working closely in a team. I have lots of areas of responsibility but lots of people around to support me who help me achieve success."
